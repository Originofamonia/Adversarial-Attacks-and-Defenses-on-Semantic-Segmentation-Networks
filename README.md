# Adversarial Attacks and Defenses on Semantic Segmentation
Welcome to the repo of Adversarial attacks and defenses on Semantic Segmentation. Adversarial attacks prove to be the biggest challenge for deep neural networks. Even many state-of-the-art architectures are vulnerable to these attacks. Although many journals have tried to explain the defense mechanisms, we introduce other such methods focussing specially on Semantic Segmentation models and datasets like MS-COCO, PascalVOC, Cityscapes. 

## Plan of Attack
The main idea is to perform various adversarial attacks in extension to the attacks and defenses provided by ........ We begin with attacking basic datasets like MNIST, CIFAR10 and then tried to transfer the effects on to semantic segmentation networks.
